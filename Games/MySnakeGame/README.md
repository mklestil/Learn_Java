# MySnakeGame

A small snake game with JavaFX. The goal of the project was to create a functional game with a clear separation of model, view, and controller â€“ including a SceneManager as a singleton for UI management.

## Features

- JavaFX frontend (FXML-free, purely programmatic)
- SceneManager as a singleton for navigation between the start and game views
- MVC structure
- Planned: High score, sound, settings

## Structure

- model: game logic
- view: GUI components
- control: controls & SceneManager
